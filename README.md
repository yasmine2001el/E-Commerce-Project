# E-Commerce-Project

Today, the shift in sales of goods and services from direct sales to virtual sales is driving a greater focus on sales.  For years, online stores have been widely recommended for businesses that rely on the sale of goods and services. These types of websites serve as a global device that connects customers to all relevant information, products and services through a single portal. These online shopping sites allow customers to enjoy the available virtual lounge that is updated daily without the slightest constraint, allowing them to never miss their favorites, without problems of geographical distance, hours of work or availability of transportation. On the other hand, these sites allow the company to take advantage of this space to expose its products to a wider clientele. So, as a developer, I was asked to design and create a business website that facilitates communication between product owners and customers.
